# Blossomizer
A tool to beat your friends at the Blossom Game

https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/blossom-word-game

The program needs a file *dict.txt* that contains the english dictionnary, one word per line.

## How to use

Install OCaml :-)

- Compile the program using **make**
- Suppose the current letters of the game are *a*,*b*...*g* and that the center letter is *c*. Run **./blossomizer c a b d e f g**. Note that *c* comes first.
- Then, you can type the current bonus letter, and *blossomizer* will suggest a word to play.

Have fun!
